@title[Programming Languages]
### Programming Languages

Jupyter Notebooks can be used with a variety of different programming languages. Initially the notebookes were for *Julia*, *Python* and *R* but now they support many more languages. 

<p style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">If you don't know the languages and packages researchers use, it might be helpful to think about the types of tasks they want to perform. Python is currently the most popular language used in Jupyter Notebooks as well as R, you can also consider what is commonly used in different fields of research.</p>

Note:

- Objective: Understand languages (and packages) that are suited to different research tasks. 
- Activity: In pairs, talk about which programming language might make the most sense for you and why. When you are ready, think about how you would recommend Python or R to someone else in your field. Share this with the group.

@title[Hands On]
## Hands On

- Look at an example of a Jupyter Notebook [in GitHub](https://github.com/ingridbmason/Intro-to-Jupyter/blob/master/AARNet_Intro_Jupyter.ipynb)
- Identify the cells, what is input and what is output, and what is markdown. Discuss the types of output. 
- Examine the code. Different colours are used. Have you seen that before? Why do you think different colours are used?

Note: 

If you have seen or used the command line before, can you think of any reasons why Notebooks might be easier to use? Discuss your ideas and experiences with the group. If you haven't used the command line before, have a think about why notebooks could be less daunting for beginners.
